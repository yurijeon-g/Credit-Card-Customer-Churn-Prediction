# Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This notebook goes through various machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and LightGBM to predict whether a customer would churn. The best roc-auc score models' hyperparameters were tuned in an attempt to get better evaluation metrics.

## Overview

In this project, I aim to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a credit card dataset, using visualization techniques. Through univariate and bivariate analyses, I aim to extract valuable insights from the data that will reveal the behavior of customers who have churned. By understanding these patterns, we can provide better services to these customers and potentially reverse their decisions. Additionally, I intend to use this data to build a model that predicts customer churn the bank can use to reduce customer churn.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of information on 10,000 customers, including their age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. Only 16.07% of customers have churned, thus the dataset has a class imbalance. In order to increase predictive and classification efficacy of the models, techiques such as oversampling the training set was applied.
